# Redis Clone - Learning Exercise

This project is a Redis clone that aims to be compatible with the standard Redis client. It's a learning exercise to understand how in-memory data stores work, network programming, and the Redis protocol.

## Goals

* Implement a subset of Redis commands
* Maintain compatibility with standard Redis clients
* Learn about TCP servers, protocol parsing, and concurrent data structures
* Understand memory management and persistence mechanisms

## Current Status

This is a work in progress. The implementation will focus on core Redis functionality while maintaining the simplicity needed for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

(Instructions will be added as the project develops)
